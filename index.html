                <p>
                    As mentioned in my introduction, I hold a B.S.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from the 
                    University of Iowa, graduating in Spring 2023. My coursework emphasized solid software design 
                    principles and exposed me to a broad range of technologies, including Embedded Development, Operating 
                    Systems, Web Development, and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my studies, I worked with a wide variety of programming languages and 
                    toolsâ€”Assembly, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Python. While I didn't 
                    become an expert in all of them, the experience taught me how to quickly learn new 
                    technologies and confidently choose the right tool for the job. My time in school shaped 
                    me into the proactive, adaptable learner I am today.
